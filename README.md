# drig-discovery-prediciton
 A project using Python and pretrained models for graph neural networks could be to develop a predictive model for drug discovery.

The goal of this project would be to use graph neural networks to predict the properties of new drug compounds based on their molecular structures. This would involve training a model on a large dataset of known drug compounds and their associated properties, such as their effectiveness in treating certain diseases or their side effects.

To accomplish this, you could use a pretrained graph neural network model such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or the Graph Attention Network (GAT). These models are trained on large datasets of graphs and are capable of extracting meaningful features from graph structures.

You would first need to preprocess the drug compounds into graphs, where each node represents an atom and each edge represents a chemical bond between the atoms. Then, you could use the pretrained graph neural network model to extract features from the graph representations of the drug compounds. These features could then be used to predict the properties of new drug compounds.

Once you have developed the model, you could integrate it into the drug discovery pipeline of a pharmaceutical company. This would allow the company to quickly and accurately predict the properties of new drug compounds, potentially saving time and money on expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments.
